## Wireframes
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:


### Desktop Wireframe
### Tablet Wireframe
### Phone Wireframe


   # Color 


## Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") 
to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
 For the main text I have chosen 
 [Exo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo?query=mon "Exo") 
 as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. 
 To make the headers and the navigation bar stand out form the text, 
 I decided to use 
 [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=rob "Roboto").
 

#

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

Colors Used: 

 * #292929 - This colour will be used as a Footer Background Color,submit buttom and text Color.

 * #616161 - This colour will be used on the "back to the top" buttom as hover color.

 * #FFFFFF - This colour will be used as a background colour, Navbar and Footer as a text colour.


 


    




## Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Deployment

Following writing the code then commiting and pushing to GitHub, this project was deployed using GitHub by the following steps.

+ Navigate to the repository on github and click 'Settings'.
+ Then select 'Pages' on the side navigation.
+ Select the 'None' dropdown, and then click 'master'.
+ Click on the 'Save' button.
+ Now the website is now live on https://emanuelcaires.github.io/Factorygym/
+ If any changes are required, they can be done, commited and pushed to GitHub and the changes will be updated.






# Testing

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. 
The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, 
the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, 
large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and
 aslo make contact via the contact form or social media simply. It the content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded as to put the user off.

 + In my wireframes,  I had designed three different types of devices Desktop View, Mobile View and Tablet View.

+ While I was developing the site, this did not make sense. 

+ There was such a long scroll with it being a one-page site, I felt I needed to speed up the movement for someone who was instantly interested so included it on all screen sizes.

+ On actual smaller devices, instead of on Chrome Developer, the main navigation menu did not drop down. 

+ I found that I was repeating a lot of code in my style.css file in order to centre items. 
+ I created a class to do this and then applied it when needed.
 + When I was validating the HTML code, I had a few errors showing. This was in the classes form where I had a method of width and height.


 

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#l75c45")
    - CSS validator [results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator#css")

 
 

 + When going through my UX section, to ensure that all my goals were met for the project, I noticed that I had missed one, 'As a user, I want to know that the club is well established'. I adjusted the text in the welcome section to suit.
